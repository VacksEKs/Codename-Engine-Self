# Friday Night Funkin' - Codename Engine (WIP)

## PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS STILL IN AN ALPHA STATE

Early alpha of Codename Engine, known issues:
- Some options are missing
- Week 5 has no monster animation
- Week 6 still have no dialogue
- Week 7 have no running tankman

Build instructions are below, use the "introMod" folder for... mods. Also, `lime test windows` uses the source assets folder instead of the export one.

## CREDITS
- Credits to Smokey555 for the fancy Animate Atlas code

## HOW TO BUILD
- Install the required libraries as told in the original Funkin' repo (with latest Haxe!)
- Run `update.bat` to install all required additional libraries (flixel fork, hscript fork...)
- Run `lime test windows` to compile the game (may take a long time)
